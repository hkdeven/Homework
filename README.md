#Stock Ticker    

Build your own stock ticker web scraping program. Every time you run it, you should get the current price for **AAPL**    
(or any other user entered value via ARGV).

As a bonus, additional features to consider include:

- [x] Format the price to look like a money value.
- [x] Allow the user to specify a stock symbol.
- [x] Display additional data about the stock, like the previous close price.

*Note gemfile requirements.
